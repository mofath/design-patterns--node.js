# Introduction

This repository can be used to learn design patterns as well as writing better Node.js code. It contains a collection of some classic GoF design patterns implemented in JavaScript using the ES6 classes with Node.js APIs.

Contribution is appreciated and more than welcome, adjust README.md of existing pattrn, or improve examples or add new pattern. Just make a fork, make your change and submit a pull request.

**NOTE**

Keep your changes consistent with the rest of the project's code, naming convention, ES6 coding style, and structure.

# Patterns implemented

Patterns are grouped into three directories based on their category. Each pattern is put in subdirectory with index file with testing, and README.md to get an overview about the pattern.

### Creational Patterns
